    <h1>Privacy Policy for Odoo Kaching</h1>

    <p>
      Odoo Kaching is a simple Chrome extension that plays a short “ka-ching”
      sound when an Odoo payment-success element appears on a page.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      This extension does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, transmit, or
      process any personal data. It does not read the user's browsing history,
      form entries, identity, files, or any other personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>No Third-Party Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      The extension does not share, sell, or transfer any data to third parties,
      because it does not collect any data at all.
    </p>

    <h2>Local-Only Operation</h2>
    <p>
      All functionality runs entirely within the user’s browser. The extension
      only listens for the presence of a specific DOM element
      (<code>o_payment_successful</code>) in order to play a local audio file.
      No information is sent over the network.
    </p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      Any permissions requested by the extension are solely used to detect the
      payment-success element on Odoo pages. They are <strong>not</strong> used
      to access or store user information.
    </p>
